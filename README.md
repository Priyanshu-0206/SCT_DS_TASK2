# SCT_DS_TASK2
# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my solution for **Task 2** assigned during my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**. The task involved learning and performing **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset.

## 📌 Objective
- Handle missing values
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis
- Create visualizations to understand patterns in the dataset
- Generate insights useful for machine learning or predictive modeling

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in 'Age' with **median**.
- Imputed missing 'Embarked' values with **mode**.
- Dropped 'Cabin' column due to excessive missing data.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics** of numerical features.
- **Visualizations** created:
  - Survival Count Plot
  - Survival by Gender
  - Survival by Passenger Class
  - Age Distribution Histogram
  - Fare Distribution Histogram
  - Survival by Embarkation Port
  - Correlation Heatmap for Numeric Features

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
